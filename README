Project 2 README

Files that should be included in this submission:
	main.py
	PDA.py
	stack.py
	dpda
	dpda1.txt
	dpda-input1.txt
	pda2.txt
	pda3.txt
	dpda4.txt
	dpda-input4.txt
	report.pdf
	README
	

Execution command:	./dpda [pda description file] < [file containing tape inputs] > [output file]

Execution examples:
		./dpda pda1.txt

		./dpda pda1.txt < pda_input.txt
		
		./dpda pda1.txt < pda_input.txt > pda_output.txt


Note that if you are running the program without a file containing tape inputs, you will first have to enter an integer value for the number of tape inputs to be read.  You can then enter tape inputs formatted as so:
	a,b,b,a,a,e,a

	a,d,a,d,a

Once you have entered the specified number of tape inputs you can once again input another integer value and enter another set of tape inputs.


I have also included the files which I used to test/verify this program:
	dpda1.txt
	dpda-input1.txt
	pda2.txt
	pda3.txt
	dpda4.txt
	dpda-input4.txt
